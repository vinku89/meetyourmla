<p><strong>NO COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY:</strong></p>
<p>The Car-pool Platform and the Services are strictly limited to providing a Service for Car Owners and Co-Travellers to car share in a private capacity. The Services may not be used to offer or accept car sharing for hire or reward or for profit or in any commercial or professional context. The Services may be used only to offer or accept car sharing in exchange for sharing the cost of the Trip between the Car Owner and the Co-Traveller.</p>
<p>Car Owners agree not to obtain any hire or reward or make profit in any form, from any Trip. The Cost Contribution may only be used to discharge the Car Owner's costs and may not be used to generate any hiring charges or reward or profit in any form for the Car Owner. The Car Owner is not entitled to make profit by virtue of the amount of the Cost Contribution, the types of Trips offered by a Car Owner, the frequency of such Trips or the number of Co-Travellers transported. This applies to all activities, arrangements and Services booked using the Car-Pool Platform and any additional services or activities which may be agreed between Car Owner and Co-Traveller through the Car-pool platform.</p>
<p>The Car Owner must not provide any additional services to the Co-Traveller in exchange for hiring charges or any reward or for profit or otherwise (and the Co-Traveller may not accept or ask for any such services) including (without limitation) package delivery, waiting time, additional drop offs and pick-ups and collecting additional Co-travellers (other than the Co-Traveller).</p>
<p>All Trips, collection points and destinations must be pre-agreed through the Car-pool Platform between the Car Owner and Co-Traveller. Car Owners may not collect any Co-Travellers from any location which has not been pre-agreed with the Co-Traveller through the Car Pool Platform. The Company shall not be involved in determination of the Cost Contribution between Car-Owner and Co-Traveller. The Company shall not be liable for any loss or damage incurred by a Member as a result of any breach by Member of these Conditions including where any car-owner (in breach of terms) offers Services through Car-pool Platform or any break-down of the car during the journey or any offerings of trips in violation of the Conditions shall be at the sole risk of such Member.</p>
<p><strong>INSURANCE: (DA VERIFICARE BENE CON AVVOCATO)</strong><p>
<p>The Car Owner agrees and undertakes to take out and maintain a comprehensive insurance to cover third party liability, the occupants of the Vehicle and the Trip offered or booked through the Car-pool Platform. The Car Owner agrees that they will, on request, provide the Co-Traveler with evidence, in advance of the Trip, of the complete validity of its insurance policy. The Car Owner also undertakes to hold a valid driving licence and that the Car Owner will own or will be entitled to use the Vehicle and that the Vehicle will have a valid certificate and the Co-Traveler is entitled to request evidence of the Car Owner's insurance, registration certificate ('log book'), driving licence and at any time up to completion of the Trip.<p>
<p>It is Company's understanding that governmental authorities take the view that a Co-Traveler who contributes only towards travel expenses is treated as travelling without hire or reward to the driver, and is therefore a third party passenger who is covered by comprehensive third party insurance policy in Australia. However the Company gives no warranty or assurance in this regard and it is the Car Owner's responsibility to verify that their insurance provides adequate cover. It is up to each Car Owner and Co-Traveler to confirm with each other that the Car Owner is covered by valid insurance. The Car Owner must confirm that their insurance policy allows them to carry Co-Travelers and that their insurance policy covers all Co-Travelers and any accident or incident which may occur during a Trip.</p>
<p>The Car Owner and the Co-Traveler are aware that standard non-commercial insurance policies may refuse to cover loss or damage arising in the event that the Car Owner had made or was seeking to make a profit.</p>
<p>The Car Owner may collect no payment from the Co-Traveler other than the Cost Contribution and the Car Owner must not in any event provide vehicle on hire or for reward in any form.</p>
<p>The Car Owner therefore undertakes to calculate their expenses (fuel, toll, maintenance, repairs, depreciation and insurance of their vehicle) and guarantees that the total Cost Contributions requested from their Co-Travelers does not result in the vehicle running for hire or for reward. If the Car Owner does receive any hiring charges or reward, or if the insurers repudiate or refuse to accept any claim arising during a Trip for any other reason, the Car Owner will be responsible for the financial consequences, losses and damages arising and the Company will not be liable under any circumstances to the Car Owner or the Co-Traveler. The Company reserves the right, but not the obligation at its own discretion, to suspend / block immediately the account of a user including the money displayed and to make aware to competent authorities any professional activity.</p>
<p><strong>CAR-OWNER AND CO-TRAVELLER RELATIONSHIP:</strong></p>
<p>The Company does NOT provide Transportation services, being only a mean of supporting Ride Sharing as a way to benefiting its users. Therefore, when requiring or accepting to share a ride, the users understand that the Company does not have any direct bond with any user, just easing the Car Owner – Co-Traveller contact.
